Pour les Français ça se passe ici : https://github.com/gabrielmartinezservili/Objet-Memoire

Here is the GitHub page in English, dedicated to my master thesis. Unfortunately I can't use the same semantics as in French. It is composed in two parts, an object and a writing. Both are complementary, I invite you to go to the following web page to read the writing: https://gabrielmartinezservili.github.io/objet-ecrit/

 Although it's in French you can translate it via the "*Google translate*" extension.
 
The "*object*" part is a manifest graphic object designed to be manufactured using 3D printing.  It is an attempt to revalue our interactions with the world of technical objects. With the aim of bringing about an engagement between the individual, the tool and its functioning. It has been designed so that anyone can make it their own. It is modular and open, its design is totally transparent.

#### This is what led me to create it : </br>
Being in graphic design by training, it was during my art school course that I was challenged by the fact that we were using graphic production objects, such as pens or printing systems, without any real awareness of their functioning and the physical phenomena they imply. Although there is a wide range of graphic tools available, we make our choices according to a desired effect that implies the use of a specific object. The exploration of possibilities is reduced to a minimum, we simply expect them to work the way we want them to, through meaningless and minimal interactions. Thus, by no longer asking ourselves how they work, we have lost the intuition of gesture. The idea that our technical objects are simply destined to carry out our orders puts a brake on our creative relationship with them.
